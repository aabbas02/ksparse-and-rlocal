# Alternating minimization algorithm for unlabeled sensing and linked linear regression
This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the alternating minimization algorithm proposed in the [Alternating Minimization algorithm for unlabeled sensing and
linked linear regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.07621).

## Instructions
* For linux systems, replace ' \ ' at the beginning of the the main.m files in the `figures` folder by ' / '.
* To reproduce any of the results in [1], run the corerresponding file in the `figures` folder. For example, to reproduce Fig. 3(a), run  the `fig3a.m` file in the folder `Fig3`. 
* To reproduce the results on real-datasets in Table 1, please first install [CVX](https://cvxr.com/cvx/).
* The `sarcos` dataset (see Table 1 of Reference) is a large dataset, with a long run-time. The results for that dataset are provided in the MATLAB data file `sarcos.mat`
