# Alternating Minimization Algorithm for k-sparse and r-local Unlabeled Sensing
This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the alternating minimization algorithm proposed in the [Alternating Minimization algorithm for unlabeled sensing and
linked linear regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.07621).

## Instructions
* To reproduce any of the results in [1], run the corerresponding file in the `figures` folder. For example, to reproduce Fig. 3(a), run  the `fig3a.m` file in the folder `Fig3`. 
* NOTE: For linux systems, replace ' \ ' at the beginning of the the main.m files in the `figures` folder by ' / '.
